* Critical Addiction Factors in World of Warcraft
    * **Belonging: Avatar Creation** --- Players can choose to represent the “Horde” or the “Alliance” factions and select a corresponding character race and combat class.
    * **Obligation: Garrison** --- Garrison missions are initiated by a user-prompted timer, requiring players to log in to the game on an hourly to daily basis to fully complete.
    * **Reward: Achievements** --- Achievements can be earned for successfully completing events or quests on an applicable character. Many achievements give titles or items as rewards.
    * **Curiosity: Game World** --- There have been 5 content expansions released for World of Warcraft. Every expansion has also released a new content region. It takes days to fully explore.
    * **Role-play: Server Type** --- There are 4 different WoW server types that dictate how the game is played: RP = role-play, Normal = PvE (player v. environment), PvP = player v. player, RPPvP.

        * However, being aware of the 5 critical addiction factors implemented by game developers may help decrease the rising trend of college aged MMORPG addiction.
        * If you are a developer of an MMORPG, designing the user interface with these factors in mind is beneficial to avoid promoting addiction in your player-base.
