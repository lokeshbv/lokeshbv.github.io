Below the break is an explanation of my Lab 1 in Digital Logic Design.

<!--break-->
Design a combinational logic circuit which has one output Z and a 4-bit input ABCD representing a binary number. Z should be 1 iff the input is at least 5, but is no greater than 11. Use one OR gate (three inputs) and three AND gates (with no more than three inputs each).
