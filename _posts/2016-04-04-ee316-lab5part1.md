Below the break is an explanation of my Lab 5 Part 1 in Digital Logic Design.

<!--break-->
Design a Mealy sequential circuit (Figure 16-27) which investigates an input sequence X and will produce an output of Z = 1 for any input sequence ending in 0010 or 100.

<i>Example:</i><br>
X = 1  1  0  0  1  0  0  1  0  1  0  0  1  0  1

Z = 0  0  0  1  0  1  1  0  1  0  0  1  0  1  0
