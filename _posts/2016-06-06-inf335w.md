During the 2016 nine-week summer session, I will be taking the web-based version of INF 335W (Information in Cyberspace). This is the first course that I am taking for credit towards my major's secondary core requirement, Academic Enrichment. From what I know from looking around the online Canvas course page, this class should be pretty interesting and should help me expand my knowledge base regarding controversial topics in the world of Information Technology.

Throughout the summer I will be required to update an online Wordpress blog with my research and findings. My blog is hosted on UT's Blog Service, [you can view it here](http://sites.utexas.edu/jplunkett/).
