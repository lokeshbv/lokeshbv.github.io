#### Creative Commons License Explanation

Since I will be posting my work onto the internet, I would like others to be able to share my work via blog mentions, Facebook posts, etc. It is kind of naïve to think that users will decide not to share your work without prior consent just because you place a Creative Commons “NoDerivatives” license inhibiting the sharing of your work on your webpage. Assuming my work will be placed on WordPress, I decided to choose a “derivatives” license.

I would like to receive some sort of credit for my work, whether this just be in the Citations portion of an article or forum post, etc. However, again, it is naïve to think that someone won’t just copy and paste my work without proper attribution to my website, work, and/or name. Disregarding these assumptions, I have chosen an “attribution” based license (in the hopes that a mindful user will properly credit me).

Derivatives and remixes of my work are definitely OK, as long as they properly credit me for their use of the original work. The Creative Commons license at its core is to promote creativity and to allow a body of work to be legally and freely available for sharing and repurposing (source). I wouldn’t want to go against the Creative Commons core movement in a selfish way.

Finally, since I didn’t envision myself selling my creative work for a profit in the first place, I do not really want it to be available for free use commercially. If my goal was to see my work on a billboard or in a TV commercial, I would apply for a marketing position at a company outright and not do creative work for free (and also freely available). Maybe that is a closed-off mindset, but business is business. For these reasons I have chosen a “NonCommercial” Creative Commons license.
